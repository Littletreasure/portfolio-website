          Welcome to my portfolio website. I have recently graduated from

          Coding Bootcamp and I am now looking for my first job as a software
          developer.

          Since leaving Northcoders I have been practicing React and React
          Native creating a couple of apps for my own benefit. One to keep track
          of all my books and a newer version to also keep track of films and
          computer games. I have also created a basic website to access the
          Chuck Norris joke api - this was for a tech test. I have recently
          designed a website to access the Animal Crossing api. The
          functionality of this site is now working but the design is still in
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been exploring other technologies recently and have watched a
          few tutorials on React Redux and React Hooks. I have completed the
          Python 2 and PHP courses on Codecademy and I am currently working
          through the SQL course to refresh my knowledge. I plan to explore
          Redux and React Hooks more and also have a look at Typescript.
