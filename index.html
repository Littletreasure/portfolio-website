          Coding Bootcamp and I am now looking for my first job as a software
          developer.

          Since leaving Northcoders I have been practicing React and React
          Native creating a couple of apps for my own benefit. One to keep track
          of all my books and a newer version to also keep track of films and
          computer games. I have also created a basic website to access the
          Chuck Norris joke api - this was for a tech test. I have recently
          designed a website to access the Animal Crossing api. The
          functionality of this site is now working but the design is still in
          progress.
        </p>

          I have been exploring other technologies recently and have watched a
          few tutorials on React Redux and React Hooks. I have completed several
          courses on
          <a
            href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/Littletreasure"
            target="_blank"
            >Codecademy</a
          >
          including PHP and Python 2. I plan to explore Redux and React Hooks
          more and also have a look at Typescript. I have also been working
          through
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"
            >freeCodeCamp</a
          >
          and have almost completed the Front End Libraries Certification. I
          have completed 2 of the 5 projects in
          <a href="https://codepen.io/littletreasure" target="_blank"
            >CodePen</a
          >
          and also using React in VSCode.
